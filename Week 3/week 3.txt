In week 3, We learned about plugins and packages. Also, we learned Firebase.
I learned how to set up account on firebase, create authentication with email and password and phone, i learned how to use firebase Realtime and firestore database.
Then I created a notepad app using that knowledge which has authentication and is connected to firebase firestore.

I have already created same notepad app using SQLite.
